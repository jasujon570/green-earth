## 1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?

var is a functional-scoped keyword, hoisted and start with undefined, redeclareable and reassignable.
let is a block-scoped keyword, hoisted but not initializable, reassign the value is possible but redeclare is not possible. 
const is a block-scoped keyword, oisted but not initializable, reassign and redeclare is not possible. 

## 2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()? 

forEach() executes a function for each item without returning a value
map() changes each item and gives a new list
filter() picks only the items for a new list

## 3) What are arrow functions in ES6?

Arrow functions are a shorter and simpler way to write functions in JavaScript. They were introduced in ES6 to make our code cleaner and easier to read, especially for small, one-off functions.

## 4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?

Destructuring is a feature that lets us unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into their own separate variables.

## 5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?

Template literals are a modern, easier way to create strings in JavaScript. Instead of using single (') or double (") quotes, we use backticks (`). They make it simple to embed variables, expressions, or even create multi-line strings without hassle.
